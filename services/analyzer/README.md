# Analyzer

Analyzer is a REST API Service written in Python w/ FastAPI. It's primarily used to run ML Models from within the `services/experiments` directory to extract things like topics and sentiment from user journals

## Notes

Testing got a little scuffed, having to spin up MLFlow every time would have been a pain and I don't have 24/7 remote instances running to leverage here either
